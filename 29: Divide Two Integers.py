Approach:
      
      For example, we divide(5000, 14):

        1. After the first inner loop: the_sum = 3584 which is 14 multiplied 256 times.
        2. We can't multiply any more â€” because after 256 is coming 256 + 256 = 512 and 14 * 512 = 7168 which is larger than our dividend, so we exit the inner loop,
        3. Reducing dividend: dividend = 5000 - 3584 = 1416
        4. And moving to another cycle of outer loop
        5. After the second inner loop: the_sum = 896 which is 14 multiplied 64 times.
        6. Third: the_sum = 448 which is 14 multiplied 32 times. And so on
        7. Finally we have: quotient = 256 + 64 + 32 + 4 + 1 = 357
